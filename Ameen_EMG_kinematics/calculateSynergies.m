function [numSynergies, VAFs, W, H] = calculateSynergies(emgData, muscleNames, VAFthresh)

%% PURPOSE: CALCULATE THE MUSCLE SYNERGIES PRESENT IN EMG DATA
% Inputs:
% emgData: struct of filtered EMG data. Each field is one muscle. Each
%   muscle's data is a 1xN vector, which can be one gait cycle, one whole
%   trial, etc.
% muscleNames: 1xM array of muscle names. These are the only muscles for 
%   which the synergy is calculated. Also defines the order of the W & H
%   matrices.
% VAFthresh: scalar double integer (0-1). The threshold to determine the
% number of synergies
%
% Outputs:
% numSynergies: scalar double. The number of synergies found.
% VAFs: M x 1 vector of doubles. The Variance Accounted For with each
%   increasing number of synergies
% W: M x numSynergies matrix of doubles. The weights of each muscle at the
%   determined number of synergies (0-1)
% H: numSynergies x N matrix of doubles. The timeseries of synergy activations (0-1)
