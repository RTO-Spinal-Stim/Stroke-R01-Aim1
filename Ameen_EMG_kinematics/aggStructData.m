%% PURPOSE: AGGREGATE A MATRIX ACROSS MULTIPLE TRIALS/GAIT CYCLES.
% Inputs:
% dataTable: The table to aggregate a subset of.
% dataColName: The field name to aggregate. Data in this field is a struct
% prefix: The prefix to aggregate by.
%
% Outputs: A struct with fields that are NxM, where N is the number of rows
% matching the prefix, and M is the lengths of the data in each field (all
% matching lengths)
