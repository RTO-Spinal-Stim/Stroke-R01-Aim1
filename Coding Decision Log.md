## Problem: 
Previously in our data analysis, muscle synergies were quantified by combining the L & R muscles into one matrix. There are two issues with this:
1. The L & R muscles' data are extracted from gait cycles that begin and end with the L and R heel strikes, respectively. This means that the L muscles' data may be from 0-100% of a gait cycle (defined L heel strike to L heel strike), and the corresponding R muscles' data would be from 50-150% of that time period. This mismatch is problematic.
2. More typically in the literature, people quantify synergies within each leg individually. So, only the L leg muscles would be examined during a L gait cycle (L heel strike to L heel strike), and only the R leg muscles would be examined during a R gait cycle (R heel strike to R heel strike).

## Solution:
- Short term: After finding literature to support point #2, I will follow the suggestion in point #2 above, isolating each side's leg muscles during its respective gait phase. This is a relatively simple modification of the code.
- Longer term: I will examine what Nicole called a "global" synergy, with both L & R leg muscles, but adjusted so that both sides' muscles are examined within the same time period (i.e. L heel strike to L heel strike). Maybe even looking at both sides combined during L gait cycles AND R gait cycles separately, to examine global synergies during paretic & non-paretic swing/stance phases, etc.
